Areas were calculated using the following shapefiles:
* Countries: https://geonode.state.gov/layers/catalog:geonode:LSIB
* Biomes: https://ecoregions.appspot.com/

OBS: It is true that when using shapefiles from different sources, there is a possibility of variation in the calculated areas due to differences in boundary definitions.
